# Nuohtti, Digital Access to the Sámi Heritage Archives

1–6 / 2021

I completed a general training in the international Digital Access to the Sámi
Heritage Archives project. My employer was the University of Oulu. Biggest part
of my job was to design, implement and test an interactive view as part of a
search portal, which will be used to publish the results of the material mapping
conducted by the research project as part of the service being developed. All
views are fully responsive, multilingual and made accessible to people with
disabilities.

In material survey search view user can set filtering criteria. The results are
retrieved from spreadsheets. Results include a description, links, and show what
types of materials are available as badges. Description can contain url-links.
If materials are available in the search portal, link to it is provided.

predetermined. I also did two column layout but single column got chosen.

it in the map. Menu and map are synchronised using javascript and are responsive.
