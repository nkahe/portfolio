# Nuohtti, Digital Access to the Sámi Heritage Archives -project

1–6 / 2021

In this project I was part of techical team to build search portal [Nuohhti](https://www.nuohtti.com/?lng=fi). My employer was the University of Oulu. Biggest part of my job was to design, implement and test [an interactive view](https://www.nuohtti.com/Content/material-survey-results) as part of the
search portal. It was used to publish the results of the material mapping
conducted by the research project as part of project. All
views are fully responsive, multilingual and made accessible. I also did manual testing and UI enhancements for the site.

Techniques: HTML, Javascript, LESS / CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, PHP.

In material survey search view user can set filtering criteria. The results are
converted from Excel spreadsheet source material to web format. Results include a description, links, and show what types of materials are available as badges. Descriptions can contain URL -links. If materials are available in the search portal, link to it is provided.

I also did intro page to material survey. Text, color scheme and images were
predetermined. I also did two column layout but single column version was ultimately chosen for publication.

User can select country filter either by generated dropdown -menu or by selecting
it in the map. Menu and map are synchronised using javascript and are responsive. I made the clickable vector map using [JQVmap](https://www.10bestdesign.com/jqvmap/) -Javascript library.

User can also filter results by different material types.

All the pages are fully responsive and useable by touch.
