# Web application for browsing physics exercises

March - may 2020

We created a responsive web page for a company [Visim Physics](https://visimphysics.com/fi/)
using WordPress in this project that was part of my studies. We worked in team of five members. The page is used by teachers to teach physics.
Users can login and browse physics excercises which include
associated video, description, buttons to show tips, question difficulty level, the answer
and download solution as PDF or the video associated to question.

We created site with Wordpress. I mostly did implementing the responsive
UI for viewing exercises using HTML, CSS, JavaScript ja jQuery instead of relying WordPress editors or plugins.

View of single excercise in large screens. General design for views was made by the client.

The view after selecting “Näytä vinkki” / “Show tip” and “Näytä vastaus” / “Show answer”.
User can toggle different information and the layout adjusts responsively according to view- and content size.
