# Web application for browsing physics exercises

March - may 2020

We created a responsive web site for a company [Visim Physics](https://visimphysics.com/fi/)
using WordPress in this project which was part of my studies. We worked in team of five members. The site is used by elementary and high school teachers to teach physics.
Users can login and browse physics excercises which include
associated video, exercise description, buttons to show tips, question difficulty level, the answer and download solution as PDF or the video file associated for question.

We created the site with Wordpress. I mostly did implementation of the responsive
user interface for viewing exercises using HTML, CSS, JavaScript ja jQuery. I didn't use WordPress editors or plugins for the UI because they don't allow the exact look and
function client wanted. The schedule was tight but we managed to the site done and client was pleased with the results.

View of single excercise in large screens. UI design for views was made by the client and our task was to implement the plans. Videos where embedded and used external service.

The view after selecting “Näytä vinkki” / “Show tip” and “Näytä vastaus” / “Show answer”.
User can toggle different information and the layout adjusts responsively according to view- and content size. I made heavy use of CSS' Flexbox.
