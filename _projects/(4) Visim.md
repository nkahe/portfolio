# Web application for browsing physics exercises

March - may 2020

We created a responsive web service for a company [Visim Physics](https://visimphysics.com/fi/)
using WordPress in this studying project. We worked in team of five members.
In the service users can login and browse physics excercises which include
associated video, description, buttons to show tips, difficulty level, answer
and download solution or the video. Most of the site needs logging in.
It was created with Wordpress and I mostly did implementing the responsive
UI for viewing exercises with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript ja jQuery.

The view after selecting “Näytä vinkki” / “Show tip” and “Näytä vastaus” / “Show answer”.
User can toggle on and off different information and view size adjusts according to needed
video size, text length and which buttons are available and view size.
